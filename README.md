# Todo List

This is a simple todo list application for iOS, written in Swift. I have also made an Android version: [Android Todo List](https://github.com/fredrik9000/TodoList_Android)

#### The app has the following features:

- Adding and editing tasks
- Setting a priority level for each task (low, medium, high)
- Adding notifications to tasks 
- Updating and removing notifications
- Completing and uncompleting tasks
- Delete individual, all completed, or all tasks
- Dark mode
- Supports English and Norwegian languages.

#### Potential improvements:

- Undo functionality (the Android version has this)
- When adding a notification, it would be nice if it expanded down instead of navigating to a new page
- A way of adding more notes to a task, maybe increase the description field or add an additional one
- Ability to search todo items
- Notification reminders that will be triggered by location
- Launcher icons
